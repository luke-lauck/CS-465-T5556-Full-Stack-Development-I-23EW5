CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN
# Architecture
Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA). Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
Express HTML uses server-side logic to provide rendering to the front-end user interface.  It is simple to understand and easy to implement.  Angular dynamically updates the page and comes with much more complexity.
The backend used MongoDB since it is easy to implement and good at keeping a large number of unstructured data.  Any alternative would have worked as well but may have different cons.

# Functionality
How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces? Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
JSON is a format for data change between the front and back end.  Javascript may be used in both circumstances, but the types used may differ.  JSON bridges the gap by being the type of data being used.
It is hard to say specific instances where I refactored code, but a lot of the angular code I have looks like nothing from the book.  Many deprecated functions were being used and lacked coding conventions.

# Testing
Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
The go-to method for testing is to run through the program yourself.  But in this circumstance, Unit Testing is far more efficient.  With Postman's help, I could use API requests like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE without having to pull up the website.  Since security requires a login method, Postman operated both logging in, and using the website with the token.

# Reflection
How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
A degree in computer science is heavily reliant on understanding full-stack.  This course is the first of what my future career entails.  I have gained the understand of javascript and how web applications work.  With this, I have a higher chance of securing a job with my common understanding of web frameworks.
